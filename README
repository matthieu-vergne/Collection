This library provide some personal implementations of collections for Java. The first one was the user-friendly MultiMap which, at the opposite of the Apache implementation, implements a proper MultiMap interface rather than a tricky way to use Map and casting. Other features are provided and this library is expected to grow depending on personal needs. However, if you have any suggestion such as existing but not satisfying implementations (as it was for me with the Apache MultiMap) or missing implementations which seems interesting, do not hesitate to open an issue.
